	Boss: THE GREAT DETECTIVE CLUB HAS ARRIVED!
	Toto: C- could you please keep your voice at room level?
	Boss: Sorry Toto! I'm just too excited! 
	Boss: Now that we're at your grandfather's farm we will uncover the truth behind all the recent disappearances around here and etch our names into... detective heaven!
	Toto: Doro, you've been way too into this detective stuff ever since you read that detective manga.
	soundeffect: 1
	Boss: Please call me "The Boss" while we're working on a case, Toto. I need to keep my identity secret from my enemies.
	Toto: Case? Enemies? Do I need a secret identity too?
	Boss: Toto is both your name and your nickname, nobody will ever expect that!
	Toto: ... Uhhhh.
	music: giovanni
	Giovanni: Scusi?
	Boss: A MAFIA BOSS?! We're starting red hot in this case! Explain yourself! What makes you go against the great detective club and love and justice and all that is good?!

	Giovanni: THE GREAT DETECTIVE CLUB IN MY CASA?!
	Toto: ... eh?
	Giovanni: You will sleep-e with the fishes tonight bambinis.
	Boss: ... eh? eh?
	Giovanni: The guest-e room has an aquarium. Beautiful sight.
	Toto: That's just my grandpa, Doro! You've met him before!
	Toto: (Maybe I need to clear something up here, my name is Toto, and this is my childhood friend Doro (currently in love with detective manga).)
	Toto: (We came to my grandpa's farm to work on our summer break homework, "Truths and facts behind modern farming". But Doro is being a bit theatric with it.)
	Giovanni: Bambina, calling all Italians mafiosi just feeds negative stereotypicos.
	Giovanni: It's like saying all we do is eat spaghetti all the time.
	Giovanni: ... I mean we will be eating spaghetti later today but you can't-e just assume that.
	Boss: I'm sorry Mr. Giovanni, and thank you very much for letting us investigate on your land!
	Toto: Translation: "Thanks for helping us with our summer homework" 
	Giovanni: No problemino, bambino, I owe you for always helping out during summer break. Your tractor *kiss hand* molto bene!
	Toto: Dor- Boss, do you have the list of things we need for our project?
	Boss: Of course! In order to get to the heart of this case, we will need, uhhh...
	Toto: ... grain, carrots and heart-radish.
	soundeffect: 2
	Boss: As expected of my right-hand man, this is why we call you "The brain".
	Toto: ...
	Giovanni: You should be able to find everything at this farm except heart-radish, just look around with the look button and move to different locations with the move button. Confirm with A, return to previous menus with S.
	Toto: M- move button? Grandpa, are you alright?
	Boss: And we can talk to people with the talk button, right? 
	Giovanni: Exactamente, bambina.
	Toto: Wh- what?
	Boss: GREAT DETECTIVE CLUB, MOVE OUT!

[Giovanni_Giovanni]
		Boss: "So you're Toto's grandfather, huh?"
		Toto: "A- are you doubting it?"
		Giovanni: "I guess I am his grandfather then."
		Toto: "A- are you just going with the flow?"
[Giovanni_Toto]
		Boss: You didn't strike me as a farm boy, Toto.
		Toto: Well, I've been helping out here every summer break since I was little.
		Giovanni: Here is-a a picture of the bambino riding a tractor at two years old.
		Boss: ... (Huh?)
		
	[Giovanni_Boss]
		Giovanni: Bambina, what happened to your eye?
		Boss: I ate it.
		Toto: Nothing happened with it, she just thinks it looks cool.
		Boss: ...
		Boss: It does look cool though.
		
	[Giovanni_Carrots]
		Giovanni: You should be able to find some at the barn. One of my boys should be feeding them to the horses.
		Giovanni: Should he not do a good job, I will give-e him the special shoes.
		Boss: Cement shoes? Isn't that a bit anachronistic.
		Giovanni: No, I mean-e the comforting shoes we keep for comfortability emergencies.
		Boss: Hmm, I see, my mistake.
		Toto: (Is it me or does she look slightly disappointed?)
		
	[Giovanni_Grain]
		Giovanni: There is a wheat field out there somewhere. Just use the move button to move there.
		Toto: What is this button business about? Is this a smartphone thing?
		Boss: *Presses the "Thank you Giovanni" button*
		Toto: ???
	[Giovanni_Heartradish]
		Giovanni: There is no heart-radish on this farm. Could it be you mean horse-radish?
		Boss: There should be heart-radish here, it's one of the requirements to beat this game. So it has to be around somewhere.
		Toto: P- please don't break the fourth wall like this...
		Giovanni: Bambina, Ludum Dare games are notorious for often being unfinished, perhaps the developerino forgot to put it in!
		Toto: N- not you too-
		Narrator: There was, in fact, heart-radish somewhere on the farm. Satisfied, you doubters?
		Giovanni: Yup!
		Boss: Yup!
		Toto: (Ehhh?)
	[Giovanni_Horsefeed]
		Giovanni: To make specialito horse feed, you need chicken eggs, milk and the special horse cake mixture. The first two should be easy to getino, but I don't remember where the mixture is.
		Boss: We'll find it. *Stares intently at Toto*
		Toto: I- I'll find it.
		Giovanna: Once you have all the ingredients, cook it in the kitchen over there. Look at it.
		Toto: I- I'll look.
	
	[House_Table]
		Boss: So this is what they have in Italy, huh?
		Toto: We are known to have... tables.
		Boss: And those things next to them? You sit on them, right?
		Toto: The chairs? What kind of culture shock is this?
	
	[House_Outside]
		Boss: Toto, let's go outside!
		Toto: We will, but first let's make sure we have nothing else to do in here. Look at Grandpa, he's trying to hold back tears of loneliness!
		Giovanni: ... Be strong, Giovanni, be strong...
	
	[House_Shelf]
		Boss: Wow, what a collection of neat niche books!
		Boss: "How to make sure the body really sinks", "Organ scooping for amateurs" "Loneliness behind the minigun: The Al Capone Story". Your grandpa really goes with a theme, huh?
		Giovanni: The organ scooping one is too amateurish to be of any practical use, I wouldn't recommend that one.
		Boss: Good to know!
		Toto: (G- Good to know?!)
	
	[House_Cooking]
		Boss: The kitchen! Leave making the cake to me!

		Scarecrow: Refining my manhood...
		Boss: Isn't that something you do inside with the blinds shut?
		Toto: ... But why are you dressed like a scarecrow?
		Scarecrow: ... I don't want to talk about it, it's a personal issue of the soul, brother.
		Boss: We're the great detective club and we request entry to this field!
		Toto: ... Calling us something like that won't impre-
		Scarecrow: THE GREAT DETECTIVE CLUB?! ON MY FIELD? MY GOD!
		Toto: ...
		Scarecrow: But I still can't let you through. A man has his pride. And mine is being a scarecrow. You understand my manly soul, right?
		Boss: I GET IT, I GET IT. COME HERE, SCARECROW MAN! I respect your dedication.
		Boss: (Toto, we need to find a way around this guy.)
		Toto: (Ehhh, can't we just go to another field?)
		Boss: That would be admitting defeat. And you know the great detective club's rule #32. We know the word for death but not defeat!
		Toto: But if we don't know the word for defeat why is it part of the saying?
		Boss: ...
		Toto: (She's slowly walking away, that broke something in her.)

			Scarecrow: It's not a costume missy, it's a way of life. You wouldn't get it. Your life wasn't hard-boiled enough.
			Boss: Toto, put on a scarecrow costume, replication will help us understand the criminal's motive.
			Scarecrow: Criminal?!
			Toto: I- I'd rather not...
		[Scarecrow_Giovanni]
			Scarecrow: Oh, the boss.
			Boss: Me?
			Scarecrow: He picked me up hanging in a field and gave me a place to be when I had nowhere else to go with my talents.
			Toto: (So he was a scarecrow before???)
			Scarecrow: I owe him an eternal debt and then some. That's what it means... to be a hard-boiled man.
			Toto: (There's a limit to how profound you can be as a scarecrow cosplayer.)			
		[Scarecrow_Grain]
			Scarecrow: Wheat is like man. Swaying in the wind sometimes but deeply rooted. It moves my heart just taking it in.
			Scarecrow: ... Can you rotate me a little so I can take it in better.
			Toto: *rotates him*
			Scarecrow: Thanks man.
			Scarecrow: There is really only two things that grain must fear. Man and Aliens.
			Scarecrow: Someone as hard-boiled as me can take care of man, but I worry about the aliens.
			Scarecrow: If they decide to draw circles on this field, would I be able to stop them?
			Scarecrow: Sometimes I hang here for days just worrying about that.
			Boss: (Aliens, huh. Toto, are you thinking what I'm thinking?)

					Boss: Yup.
					Toto: ...
					Toto: Moving on, why can't we have those carrots?
					Lion: The balance of life.
					Toto: ... Am I talking to a markov chain reply bot here?
					Lion: If I give away a carrot, this carrot will be missing in a horse's diet, the horse will then wither and die. And it will all be my fault. I could not live like this.
					Toto: (... he says as he silently sobs into his dollar store lion costume)
					Boss: But if we don't get this carrot, we will fail school, fail to get jobs, become homeless, and starve on the street! Could you live with that?
					Lion: ...

	Toto: Grandpa! You killed those people! It only makes sense, you're the one with the fascination for organs!
	Giovanni: Bambino... it's-e true, organs are very coolito, but they are best when they are inside-e people! I would never murder anybody! No Italian would!
	Scarecrow: He makes a good point there.
	Boss: It's true. Giovanni owns the property and the shed, which makes him a prime subject. But he is not the killer. The true killer has already given away who they are. Think again, Toto.

[Investigate_corpse_Scarecrow]
	Toto: You, mysterious scarecrow man! You have a gun and you seem to be fine with shooting at people!
	Scarecrow: Woah there kemosabe, I only shoot at aliens. I wouldn't hurt an earthling fly. One planet, one destiny.
	Toto: And nobody knows why you're in that costume anyway!
	Scarecrow: Alright, I'll come clean, as a show of good faith between men. The reason I'm in that costume is because-
	Boss: Unimportant, because he is not the killer either. True, he has a weapon and is a sketchy character-
	Scarecrow: Hey!
	Boss: But the true killer has already given away who they are. Think again, Toto.

[Investigate_corpse_Toto]
	Toto: Ok, I picked the joke option, are you satisfied now?
	Toto: Can we get this over with so the unassuming lion guy who's passed out on the floor can rise up as the true villain character and hold whatever monologue he has prepared?
	Boss: ...
	Boss: The first hint is the location.
	Boss: The key card was in the tractor that you take care of during summer break. The key was among the animal feed that you are in charge of, the lion costume creep is just a temporary replacement.
	Lion: Is it too late to veto the c word now or has it entered acceptable vocabulary to describe me?
	Toto: You gotta be kidding me, we find keys to a storage shed in two accessible locations and you accuse your childhood friend to be a serial killer? There's a limit even for you!
	Boss: The second was the behaviour.
	Boss: You pretended to be unaware of the disappearances going on in this area. You repeatedly tried to take the keys we found. You tried to keep us from entering the shed with an uncharacteristic amount of aggression.
	Toto: SO BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BREAK INTO MY GRANDPA'S SHED AND NOW I SHOULD BE ON DEATH ROW?! DO YOU EVEN HEAR YOURSELF? 
	Toto: AND WHY SHOULD I TAKE YOUR DISAPPEARANCE CHUUNI BABBLE AT FACE VALUE WHEN ALL YOU EVER DO IS SPOUT OFF NONSENSE?! GUESS STRAWBERRY MILK IS MADE OUT OF COW BLOOD NOW!
	Narrator: We interrupt this programming to remind you to not fall for the big strawberry milk lobby's propaganda. Save cow lives. Today.
	Toto: SHUT UP, YOU DUMB NARRATOR. SHUT UP, SHUT UP, SHUT UP.
	Toto: JUST BECAUSE EVERYONE EXCEPT ME IS CRAZY IN THIS WORLD I'M SUPPOSED TO BE THE BUTT OF THE JOKE AT THE END?! GIVE ME A BREAK!
	Scarecrow: ...
	Giovanni: ... He sure has the Toto family passion.
	Boss: The final clue. Toto... How did you know it was the Organ Harvestinator 2000 and not the 3000 like I said.
	Toto: ... What?
	Boss: I was standing in front of the only plaque on the machine. You couldn't have seen if from where you were standing, and I covered it in tactical puke afterwards.
	Lion: (Tactical puke?)
	Scarecrow: (Let the little missy have her moment, bro.)
	Toto: ...
	Toto: ...
	Toto: ...
	music: toto
	Toto: ... Heh. How could I have anticipated the tactical puke.
	Boss: Oldest trick in the book.
	Toto: Fine. You... "win" the battle. I've been using this shed for a small organ harvesting side hustle this summer break.
	Giovanni: My own-e grandson... A organ harvesterioni...
	Lion: My best friend... a monster... an animal...
	Scarecrow: And I thought aliens could be our friends...
	Boss: I didn't want to believe it either... but a true detective must accept the facts, no matter how grim.
	Toto: ... You certainly don't look the grim part, throwing out victory signs and taking selfies to post on instagram with hashtag detective_victory.
	Boss: ... This is this and that is that.
	Toto: Well, nothing's gonna happen to me anyway, you ascended extras. I'm the main character and the main character always wins.
	Toto: I'll just bide my time until the game interface comes back and then I will turn this around in a jiffy.
	Narrator: However, the interface never came back.
	Toto: Wait, an ending narration?! No! This wasn't part of the plan! Stop! Stop this game! There must be a bug in here somewhere.
	Narrator: Toto was sent to prison, where he suffered tremendous damage.
	Toto: NO! NOT THE TREMENDOUS DAMAGE!
	Narrator: He was always picked last for the prison volleyball team-
	Lion: *closes eyes in pain*
	Narrator: His spaghetti was always broken in half on spaghetti day-
	Giovanni: Dio have mercy on this boy's soul.
	Narrator: And he was abducted and probed by aliens.
	Toto: NOW THAT'S JUST BEING NASTY!
	Boss: As for the boss, she became an international star detective, super model and pop sensation all in one.
	Narrator: What?
	Boss: What?
	Narrator: Anyway, that concludes the great detective club's incident of finding carrots, grain and a heart-rad-
	Giovanni: Ah, momento the heart-radish, I found one behind a burnt shelf in my kitchen, here-a you go bambina.
	music: boss
	Boss: INVESTIGATION CONCLUDED! FULL HAPPY END!
	Boss: Hahahahaha!
	Giovanni: Hohohohoho!
	Scarecrow: Hehehehehe!
	Lion: Hihihihihi!
	Tin man: Hahahaha!
	music: none
	Everyone: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
